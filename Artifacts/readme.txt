For replication Demo.
We have 2 modules in project.
1.Student
2.Admin

Student:
--------
After running server, we have to enter address of root: http://localhost:3000/
For regestring the contract, student should click contract link to register Honor's program.
After submission of form, student can edit or view the contract form.

Admin:
-------
From home page, admin has to login to online honor website: http://localhost:3000/

1. Login with user ID: admin@memphis.edu and Password: letmein (As per requirement, this site accessible to only 3 users(secretary, director and president) so there is no signup form for this site)
2. Once admin login, he can do all respective action as we demonstrate in video.

(Here, we deal bulk student data so for faster performance, we have use minimal CSS styling)
